This code should work fine, some of the basic instructions that i would give would be that you should just first run the program and then it will ask you to put in a number for your choice of decryption or encryption, and then afterwards if you choose to encrypt then it will ask you to put in the word that you want to encrypt and also a key word. After you do that it should output the encrypted text and then after that you should rerun the code and then choose decrypt this time and put in the encrypted word and key and then you should get the decrypted version of the word that you originally encrypted.
